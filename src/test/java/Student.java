/*Simple Points to Say

I created a Student class with two instance variables: name and age.

I used a constructor to initialize these variables when creating an object.

I added an output() method to print the student details.

In the main() method, I created three objects of Student with different values.

For each object, I called the output() method to display the studentâ€™s name and age.

The program demonstrates object creation, constructor usage, and method calling in Java.
